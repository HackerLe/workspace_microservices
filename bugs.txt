bug list:

# Cannot read the HTTP response of the restTemplate call for other microservices——
The last parameter of restTemplate's postForObject/getForObject method must be the class of the return object
of the request url, the properties' name must be the same.

# The url mapping is ambiguous——
Two paths of the RequestMapping annotation is the same

# When executing the "ADD ./target/ts-food-service-1.0.jar /app/",  cannot find the jar package——
Change the version of pom.xml to 1.0
